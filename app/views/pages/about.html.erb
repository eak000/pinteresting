  <h2>What is GIF Palace?</h2>
  <p>GIF Palace is a place to pin and find GIFS to share with your friends. You can create an account and upload your own GIFS here so you can find them later. It's like Pinterest, but just for GIFS.</p>
  <h2>Behind the Scenes</h2>
  <p>Built with Ruby on Rails and Bootstrap. This project is from One Month Rails.</p>
  <p>Though I have worked with Rails and erb before from a front-end perspective, this project allowed me to learn about the entire process. I learned more about routing and simple CRUD operations in Rails, and about installing gems to get certain functionality. I used <a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/devise">Devise</a> to set up and authenticate users. I styled the app using Bootstrap and <a href="http://masonry.desandro.com/">jQuery Masonry</a>. I used <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/paperclip-s3">Paperclip</a> and an S3 bucket on AWS to upload and store images from heroku. I also learned about using the Rails console to debug my application as I went along. </p>
